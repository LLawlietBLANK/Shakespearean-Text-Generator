Shakespeare Text Generator
A neural network-based text generator inspired by the works of William Shakespeare. This project uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM or GRU layers built with TensorFlow/Keras. It is trained on an open-source Shakespeare dataset to generate text that mimics Shakespearean language.

Project Description
This project is a simple text generation model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) layers to generate text in the style of Shakespeare. It uses a dataset of Shakespeare's works and trains a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate new sentences that resemble his writing style.

By training on the dataset, the model learns the structure and patterns of the language and is able to create new text that sounds like it could come from Shakespeare.

Features
Text generation in the style of Shakespeare

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture, with options for LSTM or GRU layers

Trains on an open-source Shakespeare dataset

TensorFlow/Keras implementation

Adjustable training epochs and sequence length

Text sampling at various "temperature" levels for creative output

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed:

Python 3.6+

TensorFlow (tested with version 2.0+)

NumPy

Keras (installed as part of TensorFlow)

pip (Python package manager)

Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/shakespeare-text-generator.git
cd shakespeare-text-generator
Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects.

Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

Windows:

bash
Copy
Edit
venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy
Edit
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Prepare the Dataset
The project automatically downloads the Shakespeare text dataset via TensorFlow's get_file() function during training. However, you can manually download it if needed from this Shakespeare text dataset.

Usage
Step 1: Load the Pretrained Model
To generate text after training, you can load the pre-trained model saved in the textGenerator.keras file.

python
Copy
Edit
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

model = load_model('textGenerator.keras')
Step 2: Generate Text
Use the following function to generate text from the model:

python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np
import random

# Load your model and set up your text generation function
def generate_text(model, start_string="Shakespeare", length=1000, temperature=1.0):
    # Implement your text generation logic here
    # This involves sampling from the predicted probabilities and generating text based on that
    pass

generated_text = generate_text(model)
print(generated_text)
You can adjust the start_string, length, and temperature (controls the randomness of text generation).

Step 3: Train the Model
To train the model on the Shakespeare text, simply run the training script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train_model.py
The model will save itself in a file called textGenerator.keras.

Model Architecture
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM or GRU
The model consists of a single LSTM (or GRU) layer followed by a Dense layer with a softmax activation function to predict the next character in the sequence.

Input layer: Each input sequence is encoded as a one-hot vector where each character is represented as a vector with the same size as the number of unique characters in the dataset.

LSTM layer: This layer captures the sequential dependencies in the text.

Dense layer: This layer outputs a probability distribution for the next character.

Softmax activation: This allows the model to sample the next character based on the output probabilities.

The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and the RMSprop optimizer.

Training the Model
Training Parameters
Epochs: Number of times to iterate over the entire dataset. Default: 4 epochs.

Batch size: Number of samples per gradient update. Default: 256.

Sequence length: Length of each input sequence. Default: 40 characters.

Training Script
To train the model, run the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train_model.py
This will start the training process and the model will be saved after training.
