Shakespeare Text Generator
This project is a Shakespearean text generator built using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with LSTM layers. The model is trained on the works of William Shakespeare to generate new text in a similar style. The implementation leverages TensorFlow and Keras to train the model and generate text based on learned patterns.

Project Description
The Shakespeare Text Generator uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers, to generate text in the style of William Shakespeare. The model is trained on an open-source dataset of Shakespeareâ€™s works, learning to predict the next character in a sequence. Once trained, the model can generate coherent text based on an initial input sequence.
